0002007649,Apple A Day: The Myths Misconceptions and Truths About the Foods We Eat,Books,Widely known in Canada from hisMontreal Gazettecolumn and work with the Discovery Channel Schwarcz (Let Them Eat Flax) is an entertaining guide through the tangle of conflicting research studies advertising claims special interest groups age-old myths and popular opinion that make diet a cloudy subject. In short chapters he aims his microscope at such highly touted foods as tomatoes acai berries curry and soy; additives like nitrites artificial sweeteners vitamins and fluoride; contaminants including pesticides hormones trans fats and dioxins; and what for him are suspect fads. Schwarcz contends that while there are no magical foods a diet of mostly vegetables fruits whole grains and low-fat dairy products and moderation are key to good health. To help readers make informed choices he ably cuts through many controversies and will likely stir up a few (he challenges those who condemn milk consumption espouse detoxification and promote kosher foods for example). Schwarcz makes learning fun by peppering his text with fascinating facts (coffee contains naturally occurring carcinogens and apples have formaldehyde). More importantly he leaves readers with a rational framework for evaluating the complex nature of foods and how they affect health.(Jan.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

0002153238,The Jews in America,Books,A glossy predictable paean to American Jewry by the producers of the Day in the Life series this oversize collection of photographs traverses the country capturing cowboys and Soviet Jewry activists magicians and roving rabbis. The belabored point here is that Jews have special customs--circumcision bar mitzvah Passover seder--that set them apart but Jews are also as American as apple pie. Hence many of the 197 pictures most of them color reiterate that Jews are just regular folk: there are cozy multigenerational shots and photos of Jewish doctors astronauts hikers soldiers prisoners casket-makers emotionally disturbed youth. Cohen co-editor of Christmas in America  plays up a familiar ethnic focus on food and stardom (a photograph of Steven Spielberg and his mom Leah Adler who owns a kosher L.A. restaurant combines the two themes). A picture of the Jewish attorneys of a Century City law firm smacks of ghettoization and one of a woman immersing herself in a Brooklyn ritual bath is intrusive.Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information Inc.

Many had participated in A Day in the Life of Canada ( LJ 11/1/85) and the similar books on Australia and Hawaii. This however is the first such coverage of a non-Western non-English-speaking country. The color photographs are sumptuously reproduced and every one holds our attention. The pictures are arranged chronologically from early morning until late at night. A map of Japan shows where each was taken. Photographers are credited next to their pictures and biographies of participants follow the picture essay as does a story about their experiences taking these 300 pictures chosen from some 135000 exposures. The range of subjects covered is enormous and shakes up our notions about Japan. Highly recommended. Kathleen Collins Library of CongressCopyright 1986 Reed Business Information Inc.

There this lonesome British tank finally emerges to blow up a Nazi ammunition dump and its full complement of Panzers.

Coming to the throne at the age of five he ruled for 72 years and presided over the finest flourishing of French culture and one of its greatest periods of expansionist and military glory. This biography uses contemporary sources to examine the sort of monarch Louis XIV really was. The book provides an overview of the entire civilization inspired by and reflecting the glory of the Sun King and so while the character of Louis himself remains in the foreground artists like Racine Moliere Lully and Mansart (the architect of Versailles) share the middle-ground with politicians such as Cardinal Mazarin and courtiers such as the King?s mistress Louise de la Valliere. Vincent Cronin?s gracefully written biography of Le Roi Soleil founded on Cronin?s deep knowledge of this period of French history provides an illuminating portrait of the king and his court.--This text refers to an alternatePaperbackedition.

0006281052,Why Am I Afraid to Tell You Who I Am?,Books,This book by the author of Why Am I Afraid to Love? contains insights on self-awareness personal growth and communication with others.  Why do people continually hide their real selves from the people around them? Why are so many so insecure and afraid to open up? The answer explains John Powell is that maturity is reached by communicating and interacting with others. This book considers the consequences our real self faces if no one else ever finds out what we are like.  In this enduring classic the companion to Why Am I Afraid to Love? John Powell explains how to be more emotionally open and shows how people adopt roles and play psychological games to protect their inner selves. The courage to be our real selves can be developed and then we can begin to grow.  Now newly designed for a fresh audience Why Am I Afraid to Tell You Who I Am? is as relevant as it has been for twenty years. With a proven track record it continues to speak to the needs and aspirations of people today. It is best included in self help sections of general bookshops but also has a religious appeal.

Just as his flashlight grows dim a spaceship crashes and a Martian climbs out. Initially each fears the other but they quickly become fast friends. Soon they&#x2019;re carrying out a splendid plan to repair their spacecraft and get back to their homes. Children who know Jeffers&#x2019; Lost and Found (2006) and How to Catch a Star (2004) may recognize the distinctive figure of the boy with his large head sticklike legs and striped shirt and catch other visual references to the earlier books. Economy of line in both text and pictures combine with Jeffers&#x2019; flair for storytelling to create plenty of fine original scenes. The deadpan text is well matched by the slightly quirky pencil-and-watercolor illustrations which make great use of color and composition on the large double-page spreads.

000724794X,The Incredible Book Eating Boy,Books,Starred Review.PreSchool-Grade 3&mdash;Henry loves books. In fact he literally devours them. And the more he eats the smarter he gets. When he starts eating too many too fast he can no longer digest them and their contents get all mixed up. The simple cartoon illustrations twinkle with humor and feeling. Done in paint and pencil on smart backdrops&mdash;pages from old books&mdash;the pictures set the stage for the quirky story. When forced to give up eating his favorite volumes Henry eventually learns to enjoy reading them. However an actual bite taken out of the back cover suggests he still succumbs to the occasional indulgence. This well-done package will charm its audience. The snappy text works well for reading aloud but older children will enjoy exploring the subtle details hidden in the illustrations and backgrounds.&mdash;Julie Roach Cambridge Public Library MACopyright &copy; Reed Business Information a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Ratings climb through the roof when one of the &#x201C;surgically enhanced&#x201D; contestants nicknamed Barbie is killed. Could there be a murderer among the cast or crew?

Atticus Perennis is a Roman of Greek ancestry and master of the trireme Aquila. Septimus Capito is one of the first marine Centurions. The two brothers-in-arms must confront both the vagaries of the Senate with its backstabbing self-aggrandizing politics and the difficulties of developing the concept of naval warfare. Characteriza-tion tends to take a backseat to the abundant historical data as Stack fills his stirring story brimming with the minutiae of Roman military life circa 200 B.C. and the strategic details of conducting battles at sea from slave-powered galleys but fans of historical naval fiction will be thrilled by this exploration of an oft-ignored era.(July)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

0007304005,How to Blow Up Tollins,Books,*Starred Review* Iggulden follows the breakaway success of his nonfiction guide to restoring adventure to overprotected kids (The Dangerous Book for Boys 2007) with another wickedly funny and ingenious read. This time he creates an intricate fictional world in which the tiny Sparkler&#x2014;Peter Pan&#x2013;like in his mischief Ulysses-esque in his cunning&#x2014;holds together three separate stories. Tollins are tiny nectar-eating woodland creatures with elf ears and wings but bigger than the fairies they casually use as handkerchiefs. They enjoy an idyllic existence until a fireworks factory is built in the village of Chorleywood. One of the Tollins falls into a rocket producing the most bang for the buck ever witnessed and the men of the village hunt the Tollins down to use as fodder for their fireworks. Parts 2 and 3 continue Sparkler&#x2019;s perils and escapes from prison execution and a runaway hot-air balloon. Sparkler is a self-made scientist&#x2014;it&#x2019;s great fun to see him using applied chemistry for fireworks finding herbs for medicine and discovering the first steam engine. Duncan&#x2019;s full-color illustrations and maps bring the world to witty life. A note at the end likens the Tollins&#x2019; fate to child labor during the Industrial Revolution. There is much to think about and love in this beautifully realized world. Grades 3-6. --Connie Fletcher--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.

000734421X,Shatter the Bones,Books,*Starred Review* MacBride&#x2019;s seventh Logan McRae novel may be the most harrowing yet&#x2014;and that&#x2019;s saying something. The Aberdeen Scotland police detective finds himself working two kidnapping cases that couldn&#x2019;t be more different. In the first a mother-daughter singing duo made famous on the TV show Britain&#x2019;s Next Big Star is being held for ransom with the little girl&#x2019;s toes offered up as proof of their abductors&#x2019; seriousness. In the other a junkie has gone missing presumably due to her boyfriend&#x2019;s role in a drug deal. If Dark Blood (2011) suffered from slackness then this installment finds MacBride roaring back to form. The crimes are breathtakingly awful the pacing is breakneck and the stakes are higher than ever. Indeed when fallout from his actions lands close to home McRae finds himself wracked by guilt far worse than his many physical wounds. Few writers can blend bantering humor with gut-wrenching violence without it feeling cheap. MacBride entertains while still offering food for thought about what we consume as entertainment: Why does the public weep for one missing mother who may be a fame-hungry monster while not caring about another who may be a victim of circumstances? There&#x2019;s little comfort in this bleak ending but still: brilliant. Bloody. Brilliant. --Keir Graff--This text refers to thePaperbackedition.

0007344260,Close to the Bone (Logan McRae Book 8),Books,Logan McRae is doing his best to carry on after the harrowing events of Shatter the Bones (2012). His girlfriend Samantha is still in the hospital and his grip on reality is slipping (&#x201C;Like it or not you&#x2019;re still alive&#x201D; is the reminder taped to his mirror)&#x2014;good thing there&#x2019;s plenty of crime to keep his mind off things. A high-profile movie is being filmed on his Aberdeen Scotland beat and someone is reenacting occult scenes from the hit novel it&#x2019;s based on right down to the bleeding burning and hanging of suspected witches. Someone else is battering Asian men who refuse to identify a culprit. And the aging Wee Hamish is still trying to bestow his criminal empire on McRae earning the police detective unwelcome attention from Reuben the thug who actually wants to inherit. This eighth series installment delivers everything MacBride&#x2019;s fans have come to expect: knotty plotting gruesome crime scenes swinging gallows humor and some of the most creative cursing in contemporary crime fiction. An extremely solid follow-up to last year&#x2019;s return-to-form. --Keir Graff

0007344201,Birthdays for the Dead,Books,Taking a break from his Logan McRae series MacBride offers a stand-alone whose premise is pure twisted genius. Ash Henderson a big bruising police detective in fictional Oldcastle Scotland has been chasing a killer who snatches girls before their thirteenth birthday tortures them to death and then sends birthday cards&#x2014;with gruesome photos&#x2014;to the girls&#x2019; families each year thereafter. The kicker? Henderson has been getting the birthday cards too but won&#x2019;t tell anyone his missing daughter is also a victim: if he&#x2019;s taken off the case he&#x2019;ll lose his chance to catch the &#x201C;Birthday Boy&#x201D; himself. This has all the hallmarks of MacBride&#x2019;s best books&#x2014;gruesome violence foul weather pitch-black humor and entertainingly mismatched protagonists (Henderson is paired with &#x201C;freak-show&#x201D; forensic psychologist Alice McDonald). But despite all this has to offer readers so inclined MacBride needs an editor who&#x2019;s not afraid to use a knife as the book feels about 100 pages and one plot twist too long. On the other hand those who enjoy spending time in MacBride&#x2019;s dark world may not mind a bit. --Keir Graff

0007373619,House on Willow Street,Books,Kelly&#x2019;s latest novel features four women&#x2014;all beautiful all wounded in one way or another and all facing life crises at the same time. Sisters Suki and Tess hail from an Irish town where the postmistress Danae (a woman of mystery to curious townsfolk) is joined by her heartbroken niece Mara&#x2014;romances ensue. Stories with four main characters are bound to be complex and this one is no exception but plots and subplots are well handled. Secondary characters are quirky and add to the reading fun. The omniscient narration covers 20 years in the lives of the women through flashbacks artfully placed to shed a little light on present-day happenings and just enough information to ensure a suspenseful read. Kelly&#x2019;s readers will take comfort in her recognition of the humor in daily life the necessity of friendship to women and the strength of bonds among families. This modern-day fairy tale which starts out sad and ends up just fine will please Kelly&#x2019;s fans and appeal to more mature readers of chick lit. --Ellen Loughran--This text refers to thePaperbackedition.

She also discovers a Nazi war medal with the diaries and asks a retired history teacher to examine it. Within days the teacher is bludgeoned to death. Then Britta Elsy&#x2019;s closest friend as a teenager who is suffering from Alzheimer&#x2019;s is also murdered. Through the diaries Erica intuits that the solution to the mystery is rooted in events that took place during WWII. Once again L&#xE4;ckberg (The Stonecutter 2012) employs Swedish history and her setting Fjallbacka the postcard-pretty village where Falck grew up to craft an engaging tale that spans three generations of Fjallbackians. The author goes deep into the lives of a very large cast of characters and some crime lovers might balk at a 520-plus&#x2013;page novel that is almost half family saga. But taken as a whole The Hidden Child will keep fans of Swedish crime guessing until the final pages. --Thomas Gaughan--This text refers to theHardcoveredition.

She pinpoints the beginning of the decline to the Reagan era with its denigration of a government safety net. But she is nonpartisan in assigning responsibility to George W. Bush and Bill Clinton for supporting monied interests over those of the middle class; she then takes aim at Obama for expending more money to bail out Wall Street than Main Street. She also points to loss of manufacturing jobs outsourcing and globalization all with emphasis on corporate profits at the expense of workers. Although the US has faced similarly fearful times during the late 1800s and the Great Depression the middle class was not threatened as it is today...An engaging analysis of troubling economic and political trends. An alarming account - Joseph Stiglitz A voice of conscience in a time when we need conscience more than ever. - Elizabeth Warren Harvard Law School professor and author of The Two-Income Trap In precise graphic and shocking terms that will bring the crisis home to everyone...Huffington explains why special interests have become too powerful money dominates our politics and there is no sense of empathy or even shame amongst our elite.

InThe Marriage Plot his third novel and first in ten years (following the Pulitzer Prize-winningMiddlesex) Eugenides describes a year or so in the lives of three college seniors at Brown in the early 80s. There is Madeleine a self-described &#x201C;incurable romantic&#x201D; who is slightly embarrassed at being so normal. There is Leonard a brilliant temperamental student from the Pacific Northwest. And completing the triangle is Mitchell a Religious Studies major from Eugenides&#x2019; own Detroit. What follows is a book delivered in sincere and genuine prose tracing the end of the students&#x2019; college days and continuing into those first tentative steps toward true adulthood. This is a thoughtful and at times disarming novel about life love and discovery set during a time when so much of life seems filled with deep portent.--Chris Schluep--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.

0007410956,Lost in Shangri-La: Escape from a Hidden World,Books,Amazon Best Books of the Month May 2011:  Near the end of World War II a plane carrying 24 members of the United States military including nine Women&#x2019;s Army Corps (WAC) members crashed into the New Guinea jungle during a sightseeing excursion. 21 men and women were killed. The three survivors--a beautiful WAC a young lieutenant who lost his twin brother in the crash and a severely injured sergeant--were stranded deep in a jungle valley notorious for its cannibalistic tribes. They had no food little water and no way to contact their military base. The story of their survival and the stunning efforts undertaken to save them are the crux ofLost in Shangri-La Mitchell Zuckoff&#x2019;s remarkable and inspiring narrative. Faced with the potential brutality of the Dani tribe known throughout the valley for its violence the trio&#x2019;s lives were dependent on an unprecedented rescue mission--a dedicated group of paratroopers jumped into the jungle to provide aid and medical care consequently leaving the survivors and paratroopers alike trapped on the jungle floor. A perilous rescue by plane became their only possible route to freedom. A riveting story of deliverance under the most unlikely circumstancesLost in Shangri-Ladeserves its place among the great survival stories of World War II.--Lynette MongAmazon Exclusive: Hampton Sides ReviewsLost in Shangri-LaHampton Sidesis the editor-at-large forOutsidemagazine and the author of the international bestsellerGhost Soldiers which won the 2002 PEN USA Award for nonfiction and the 2002 Discover Award from Barnes &amp; Noble and also served as the basis for the 2005 Miramax filmThe Great Raid.Although World War II was the greatest conflict in the history of this planet many a jaded reader has come to the reluctant conclusion that there aren&rsquo;t any more World War II stories left to tell. At least not good ones&mdash;not tales of the &ldquo;ripping good yarn&rdquo; variety. Yet remarkably in his new bookLost in Shangri-La Mitchell Zuckoff has found one and he&rsquo;s told it with reportorial verve narrative skill and exquisite pacing.What makes this World War II story all the more fascinating is that it isn&rsquo;t really a war story&mdash;not in a strict military sense. It&rsquo;s more of an exotic adventure tale with rich anthropological shadings. In 1945 near the end of the war an American plane crashes in a hidden jungle valley in New Guinea inhabited by Stone Age cannibals. 21 Americans die in the crash but three injured survivors soon find themselves stumbling through the jungle without food nursing terrible wounds and trying to elude Japanese snipers known to be holding out in the mountains.The first contact between the three Americans and the valley&rsquo;s Dani tribesmen is both poignant and comical. The Americans Zuckoff writes have &ldquo;crash-landed in a world that time didn&rsquo;t forget. Time never knew it existed.&rdquo; The tribesmen who have never encountered metal and have yet to master the concept of the wheel think the American interlopers are white spirits who&rsquo;ve descended on a vine from heaven fulfilling an ancient legend. They&rsquo;re puzzled and fascinated by the layers of &ldquo;removable skin&rdquo; in which these alien visitors are wrapped; the natives who smear their bodies in pig grease and cover their genitals with gourds have never seen clothes before.The Americans in turn are pretty sure their boartusk-bestudded hosts want to skewer them for dinner.What ensues in Zuckoff&rsquo;s fine telling is not so much a cultural collision as a pleasing and sometimes hilarious mutual unraveling of assumptions. Though the differences in the two societies are chasmic the Americans and the Dani become&mdash;in a guarded tentative sort of way&mdash;friends.But when armed American airmen arrive via parachute to rescue the survivors relations become more tense. The Americans make their camp right in the middle of a no-man&rsquo;s land between warring Dani tribes&mdash;a no-man&rsquo;s land where for centuries they have fought the battles that are central to their daily culture. Here Zuckoff notes the ironies are profoundly rich. The Dani untouched by and indeed utterly unaware of the great war that&rsquo;s been raging all across the globe become thoroughly discombobulated when their own war is temporarily disrupted.Yes therearestill a few good World War II stories left to tell. And yes this one meets all the requirements of a ripping good yarn. Zuckoff who teaches journalism at Boston University is a first-rate reporter who has spared no expense to rescue this tale from obscurity. His story has it all: Tragedy survival comedy an incredibly dangerous eleventh-hour rescue and an immensely attractive heroine to boot. It&rsquo;s extraordinary that Hollywood hasn&rsquo;t already taken this tale and run wild with it. If it did the resulting movie would be equal partsAliveCast Away andThe Gods Must Be Crazy. It&rsquo;s as though the Americans have arrived in the Stone Age through a wormhole in the space-time continuum. The Dani don&rsquo;t know what to do with themselves&mdash;and life as any of us know it will never be the same.--This text refers to theHardcoveredition.

Adam Blackwood writes fluff pieces for a newspaper. When a noted historian tells him something shocking and then kills himself a few minutes later Blackwood smells a story without a hint of fluff. The historian&#x2019;s daughter asks for his help because she knows her father&#x2019;s death was not suicide. In Peru anthropologist Jess Silverton uncovers a sealed tomb that appears to be built by the Moche an ancient civilization that practiced gruesome sacrifice. The two worlds collide and what is eventually uncovered connects to a string of murders in which the victims were beheaded. But are these murders really suicides? Knox weaves a compelling violent tale peppered with plenty of sex that will appeal to ancient conspiracy fans comfortable with the graphic content. --Jeff Ayers--This text refers to theHardcoveredition.

0007522029,Can We Save the Catholic Church?,Books,*Starred Review* The German Swiss priest and theologian&#x2014;and most famous and prolific contemporary critic of the Roman Catholic Church&#x2014;portrays it as a gravely ill patient in need of radical therapy to recover and thrive. It is suffering from the Roman system a centralized hierarchical structure of authority monarchical in character and imperial in action. Established in the eleventh century by means of a clutch of forgeries (e.g. the Donation of Constantine) that system is K&#xFC;ng says primarily responsible for the Orthodox-Roman schism the Protestant reformation and the antiscientific and antidemocratic bias in Christianity. Ever entrenching the power of the pope and the Vatican bureaucracy especially after the 1870 declaration of papal infallibility and again after the second Vatican Council the system continues to harm the church driving out believers lay and clerical who question it discouraging vocations to the priesthood and thwarting ecumenism. K&#xFC;ng&#x2019;s prescription for restoring the church to health is many-faceted but its effective ingredients derive from early Christianity; it is deeply reformist and revivalist not revolutionary. Although the translation is idiomatically shaky here and there (e.g. ethician rather than ethicist) and K&#xFC;ng favors precision to scintillation this updated revision of a 2011 German original is an invaluable summation of a great religious critic&#x2019;s life work. --Ray Olson

0007491263,The Iron King (The Accursed Kings Book 1),Books,*Starred Review* Sporting an enthusiastic introduction by George R. R. Martin (in which he calls the book &#x201C;the original game of thrones&#x201D;) this is the first U.S. publication of the first volume of French novelist Druon&#x2019;s seven-volume historical saga collectively known as The Accursed Kings. Originally published in 1955 the novel is set in the year 1314. Philip IV the king of France has disbanded the Knights Templar arresting torturing and executing most of them. Relations between France and England are as strained as they have ever been. Philip&#x2019;s increasingly desperate search for money to pay his massive debts has virtually bankrupted the country. Against this sprawling backdrop Druon tells the story of Robert of Artois a French lord whose lands have been taken from him by his greedy aunt and whose efforts to reclaim his birthright will lead to all-out war between France and England. Unlike Martin&#x2019;s multivolume Song of Fire and Ice Druon&#x2019;s saga is based on real history and features real people as its central characters. It&#x2019;s historical fiction on a grand scale full of political intrigue family drama and characters who while drawn from life are larger than it. Fans of historical epics who have not yet discovered Druon&#x2019;s saga will be thrilled with this one. --David Pitt

Aided by the Stills who are medical writers he examines recent research demonstrating the link between hormones and headaches noting that there is much about the biochemical relationship that remains unclear. Explaining how hormones are produced and the roles they play in the transmission of pain Diamond describes headaches by type: tension vascular (migraine and cluster) and organically caused e.g. by tumors. Following chapters discuss treatments for different types of headaches including medications dietary changes (chocolate is a big culprit) relaxation and biofeedback. According to Diamond these strategies either alone or in combination can eliminate or reduce more than 90% of headaches. Illustrations.Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information Inc.

He writes so eloquently painting an amazingly detailed picture with his words&#160;... If I had to pick the one book that I could own on the personal accounts of aviators from the First World War this book would be it &hellip; [Lewis&rsquo;s] ability to captivate your imagination with his words makes for a book that is very difficult to put down once you start reading it.&rdquo;Aviation HistoryNovember 2007&ldquo;This beautiful work evokes the air war of 1914-1918 in an unusual and moving way. It was written by a sensitive artist who unlike so many of his comrades had his life preserved by a series of fortunate assignments during his career as a combat pilot. He thus acquired the skill to match his love of flying and so survived the war &hellip; Given that Cecil Lewis left school at 17 lying about his age to get into the Royal Flying Corps his ability with words is astounding. Even more remarkable is that much of his 1936Sagittarius Risingis written with passionate embracing enthusiasm of youth. His foreword wryly acknowledges this asking the reader&rsquo;s forgiveness for his inclusion of some tentative romantic encounters &hellip; a book that everyone who loves aviation should read.&rdquo;--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.

Windell stresses the need for patience empathy and above all diagnosis. He asks parents to look at the nature of their discipline problems their own expectations (reasonable or not?) the personality of the child involved the results they hope for from any disciplinary move. He outlines the depressingly familiar naggings screechings and whinings most parents resort to at some stage and tries to offer alternatives. For instance role playing can teach children to empathize with others; a contract between parent and child can set guidelines for mode of dress or other areas of conflict. Windell crisply illustrates his points with anecdotes--some of which sound too good to be true--and usefully sums up his positions at the end of each chapter. Much of the book is plain commonsense but in an area so fraught with anguish that commodity is not always easily come by and as a quick reference to the best disciplinary moves in most situations the book is helpful and well organized.Copyright 1991 Cahners Business Information Inc.

0020381026,The Art of Russian Cuisine,Books,The Art of Russian Cuisineis almost as immense as the vast expanses of Mother Russia. Filled with 500 recipes for classic Russian dishes it also provides a history of Russian food and culinary life. Anne Volokh a Russian food writer who eventually emigrated to the U.S. enlivens her work by including passages from Russian literature and historical works. She concentrates on authentic cooking often drawing recipes fromA Gift to Young Housewiveswritten by Ellena Molokhovets in the 1870s. The result brings to life how Russians ate when their rivers ran thick with fish and aristocrats had French chefs invent elaborate dishes like Veal Orloff made with two creamy sauces.Naturally Volokh starts withzakuski the antipasto-like ceremony that can constitute a meal in itself; including herring caviar salads even suckling pig in aspic. For soups there are peasant-hearty borschts--which are actually Ukrainian not Russian--and spicy Selianka an example of upper-class cooking. In Russia each soup has a proper garnish or accompaniment; Volokh provides them all from sliced eggs in cold borscht to yeasty garlic rolls with the hot kind. Dishes such as Beef Stroganoff Stuffed Cabbage proper Bliny and Pashka (the sweetened cheese dessert) require culinary expertise great patience or both to make. But dishes such as Roasted Chicken with Raisin-Studded Stuffing and Baked Trout with Walnut-Based Satsivi Sauce are simple but rich.If Russian food interests youThe Art of Russian Cuisineis worth having for its traditional recipes and the enlightening exploration of their origins.--Dana Jacobi

The drama of the triocollege students Michael Schwerner and Andy Goodman both white Northerners and James Chaney a young black activist from Mississippipits their faith in nonviolence against a murderous rage fueled by racism. Cagin and Dray who coauthored Hollywood Films of the Seventies have done their homework: interviews news reports FBI documents and trial transcripts undergird their brilliant re-creation of the incident interwoven with a full-scale history of the civil rights movement. The search for the bodies turned up many black corpses purported victims of police/Klan violence; the Klan conspirators were paroled before serving their full sentences; in the aftermath Lyndon Johnson questionably maneuvered to defuse the situation. This is surely one of the best books on the civil rights movement.Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information Inc.

Every woman does it every month: She examines her breasts hoping not to feel a lump that could change her future in a profound intimate way. Indeed breast cancer is now the leading cause of death among women between the ages of 35 and 54 and even successful treatment of the disease often involves permanent disfigurement. Told by cancer establishment giants like the National Cancer Institute and the American Cancer Society that prevention is not possible most women follow the advice of these so-called experts submitting to annual mammography and hoping for the best. In The Breast Cancer Prevention Program Dr. Samuel S. Epstein and David Steinman expose just how wrongheaded this approach is. The truth is breast cancer is not a random killer. There are many simple straightforward ways women can help protect themselves against it. Supported by a wealth of scientifically documented medically sound information this groundbreaking book outlines the unpublished &quot;Dirty Dozen&quot; risk factors for breast cancer and describes in detail the ways to avoid them including:Performing careful breast self-exams in premenopausal years instead of submitting to the carcinogenic radiation of mammogramsEating a healthful diet instead of one high in animal fat contaminated with carcinogenic pollutants and hormonesUnderstanding what a family history of the disease really means and the impact your reproductive choices may have on your riskUsing safer methods of birth control than oral contraceptives which dangerously raise estrogen levelsRidding your work and living environments of cancer-causing chemicals that can damage breast cells.In addition the authors expose the truth about the dangers of silicone breast implants estrogen replacement therapy and a host of other &quot;hidden&quot; risk factors. They also reveal how drug manufacturers and the mammography industry influence the cancer establishment in formulating its policies on prevention. Most of all they bring you the information you need to make informed decisions about your health placing in your hands the power to dramatically reduce your risks for this dreaded disease.

What about easy-to-prepare vegetarian recipes or those that are healthful? Then 1000 Vegetarian Recipes is the book for you&#151;no other vegetarian cookbook comes even close. Author Carol Gelles has spent years creating recipes for a variety of tastes and needs whether you&#39;re a beginner vegetarian long-time vegetarian or someone trying to eat meatless meals just a couple of times each week for better health. If you&#39;re a vegan (a vegetarian who doesn&#39;t eat eggs or dairy products) you&#39;ve probably been frustrated in the past by vegetarian cookbooks that don&#39;t address your needs. Again no other cookbook offers you as many choices as 1000 Vegetarian Recipes with hundreds of vegan recipes throughout (all clearly marked with a &quot;V&quot; at the tops of the recipes). And many of the lacto-ovo vegetarian recipes include vegan variations. You probably already know that the vegetarian lifestyle is a healthy one but if you&#39;re looking specifically for low-fat recipes those dishes are specially marked with a &quot;healthy heart&quot; symbol for easy reference. In addition to the 1000 recipes Gelles offers a bounty of information on vegetarian food including cooking charts for beans and grains; shopping lists for stocking the vegetarian pantry; a glossary of ingredients; a lesson on the health benefits of a meatless diet; and menu-planning advice with menu suggestions for every taste&#151;Chinese French Mexican Indian and more.

The depth of his knowledge is solid while the cadences of his prose are lovely. From his first acknowledgment of how he became interested in things of the night as a child to various chapters on night-blooming and fragrant daylilies cactuses wildflowers and orchids Loewer delights with humor and helpful information. He quotes liberally from other experts--botanists and lepidopterists poets and garden writers--adding their store of knowledge to his own considerable experience. And the lessons he teaches here are easy to learn: how and why flowers open how the human eye sees colors how bromeliads get their nourishment and how to care for all the plants mentioned in the book. Loewer includes indoor as well as outdoor plants and tropicals as well as temperate winter-hardy types. A chapter on lighting the outdoor night garden and an extensive list of sources round out this welcome addition to the gardening library. Illustrations not seen by PW.

For gardeners seeking the right plant for the right place but with no knowledge of the specific name the 1989 title arranges its catalog of 8000 plants not alphabetically by name but by season and color. It starts with color photos and descriptions of large trees separating them by seasonal interest and by color within each season. It does the same for smaller trees then for shrubs climbers perennials annuals rock plants bulbs and succulents. Expanding its coverage to over 15000 plants the 1997 encyclopedia is organized alphabetically making it an ideal reference for patrons who want to know what a particular plant looks like how it grows and its hardiness zones. Its descriptions of popular plant species like Narcissus Primula and Rhododendron are a real strength.Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information Inc.

0027000311,The Go-Around Dollar,Books,PreSchool-Grade 3-- Two things are going on at the same time here. One is a story of a one-dollar bill as it is passed from one person to another eventually ending up in a picture frame as the first dollar earned by a new store; the other is factual information about dollar bills. Each double-page spread includes a blown up picture of a bill (in black and white as required by law). The book concludes with labeled pictures of a dollar bill that explain what the symbols and various numbers mean. The full-color illustrations in the story include people from a variety of ethnic backgrounds; however the faces have a lifeless wooden look about them. Nevertheless Adams provides sound information to help youngsters understand the basics about our paper currency. Use it as a companion volume with lighter fare such as Dollars and Cents for Harriet (Crown 1988) by Betsy Maestro. --Laura Culberg Harold Washington Library Center ChicagoCopyright 1992 Reed Business Information Inc.

0027651207,Iduna and the Magic Apples,Books,Iduna is a fair-haired goddess from ancient Norse mythology who tends a magic garden in the kingdom of Asgard. In her verdant domain flowers grow alongside clear streams sweet grass and abundant fruit trees but the greatest treasure of all is a chest of golden apples that give everlasting youth and vitality to the gods. In this vivid retelling of a haunting tale disaster strikes when Thiassi hateful enemy of the gods succeeds in abducting Iduna and the apples from her paradise. With Iduna imprisoned in a fortress of stone death haunts the once-invincible gods and the magic garden withers into a perpetual doom. An ominous black raven looks on from the border on each page lending a spooky touch but the artworkfor all its careful touches and ornate landscapesis occasionally uneven. Most distressing are the portrayals of Iduna; her image is inconsistent throughout the book. Ages 5-9.Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information Inc.

0027746437,Spaceburger: A Kevin Spoon and Mason Mintz Story,Books,Grade 1-3-Kevin Spoon and Mason Mintz best friends from Doodle Flute (Macmillan 1991) are back. Mason convinces Kevin to walk the six miles to Exitville to attend the opening of Spaceburger a new fast-food restaurant which Mason claims is far superior to the numerous burger places in their own town. So the friends set off singing a song about lovely ravioli and when they arrive they are not disappointed. Pinkwater shows himself to be as ever a master of understatement but the offbeat element usually present in his books is strangely muted here. While there is an eerie spacey quality about the restaurant that lends an otherworldly aspect to the essentially simple story there seems to be something missing at the end. Bright felt-tip marker drawings are appealing although some appear unfinished. Like a fast-food meal Spaceburger might leave some readers unsatisfied but pick it up for fans.Donna L.

0027888452,Coyote Places the Stars,Books,Grade 1-5-Based on a Wasco Native American legend this dramatically illustrated pourquoi tale explains the designs of the constellations. It is the curious coyote who decides to discover the secrets of the heavens by creating a ladder of arrows he shoots into the sky. Once in the heavens he moves the stars around forming the shapes of his animal friends and he calls them all together to enjoy his handiwork. The simple quickly moving text is luminously illustrated with colorful border designs around some of the text as well as full-and double-page spreads of the constellations Southwestern landscape and animals created by painting dyes on cotton fabric and detailing with the wax-resist batik method. This technique affords an effective white outline of important objects. The onomatopoetic language makes this a natural tale for classroom reading but the artwork can be best appreciated by independent readers.Yvonne Frey Peoria Public Schools ILCopyright 1993 Reed Business Information Inc.

The book gives a wide range of information covering such topics as starting and designing a garden; dealing with climate soil lighting mulching fertilizing and watering; making compost; and controlling weeds.

0028612698,Asian Soups Stews &amp; Curries,Books,WhileAsian Soups Stews and Curriesis dedicated to what are simply called &quot;one pot&quot; dishes there is nothing simple about the vast range of foods the book covers including recipes from the subcontinent through China to Southeast Asia. Author Alexandra Greeley has drawn on her personal experiences and travels in Asia and put together one of the most comprehensive collections available. Her goal was to collect as many representative dishes as possible and present them in a user-friendly way for western chefs and kitchens--no small task considering the trying conditions and variety of languages she encountered.The book is divided by primary ingredients--chicken beef seafood and vegetables--and includes regional recipes for each. Cooks new to the cuisine will be surprised to find that Asian dishes are quickly cooked with lively flavors and bear little resemblance if any to slow-cooked stock-based western soups and stews. Greeley also does a tremendous job in debunking western conceptions about curries and demonstrates them as a staple of Asian cuisine with infinite variations--including and probably starring the incredible Lamb in Saffron Apricot Coconut and Poppy Seed Curry. In the essays that accompany each chapter Greeley takes great care to provide a cultural foundation for the food she is presenting and strives to reduce the intimidation factor faced by chefs in unfamiliar territory.Asian Soups Stews and Curriesis a great introduction for the novice Asian chef and for those with more experience Greeley provides a treasure trove of great recipes.--Mark O.

The result is an oral history of the game delivered with the crispness and color of the voices in the broadcast booth whose day--and night--job is to bring us the game. There are giants at work here: Mel Allen Jack Brickhouse Curt Gowdy and Ernie Harwell. There are newer voices too--Bob Costas Tim McCarver and  John Miller among them--butThe Storytellerstruly belongs to the sounds of the past brought into the present. Allen on Mickey Mantle is wonderfully stirring as is Gowdy on Ted Williams. Funny when it wants to be and poignant without forcing nostalgiaThe Storytellersis a bit like coming home turning on the radio and hearing the comfortable and exuberant sounds of childhood passion.  The writing is a reminder of why in an era of cold corporate ownership and player greed the game survives in the heart and somehow endures.

Filled with bustling crowds brasseries are more fun than bistros and their food more substantial than that of caf&#233;s. They cater to rich and poor early birds and night owls tourists and natives alike. Classic brasseries like Paris&#39;s La Coupole and Lyons&#39;s Brasserie Georges have been beloved by generations for their memorable flavors and generous spirit. Award-winning chefs Rick Tramonto and Gale Gand have translated the French brasserie into a style uniquely American. American Brasserie presents the most beloved recipes of their acclaimed Chicago-area restaurant Brasserie T expertly interpreted for the home cook. The recipes in this book are ones that you will want to cook from again and again. They reflect the classic dishes of France Italy and America in all their alluring flavors and textures. The book begins with appetizers and salads including Roasted Stuffed Artichokes with Toasted Nuts Lemon and Tomato; Crunchy Green Salad with Goat Cheese and Warm Bacon Vinaigrette; and Caramelized Onion Tart. Soups of all kinds follow&#151;from stars like Curried Pumpkin Soup with Apple and Toasted Pumpkin Seeds to hearty bowls of French Onion Soup with Gruy&#232;re and Country Mustard. The chapter on pasta risotti and grains is full of exciting new dishes like Orecchiette with Zucchini Chickpeas and Red Chile; Creamy Three-Grain Risotto with Artichokes and Mushrooms; and Tramonto&#39;s Escarole Sausage and White Bean Stew.

They include Cassoulet; Osso Buco; Spring Vegetable and Rabbit Fricassee; Fish and Chips in Peppery Amber Beer Batter; and delectably traditional Pot-au-Feu. American Brasserie is one of the few cookbooks to provide ideas for the cheese course.

0028643518,Behind Bars: Surviving Prison,Books,In the 1960s peace groups issued leaflets to their members on what to do if arrested during nonviolent demonstrations. Now two criminologists have come up with a guidebook on surviving the criminal justice system that is loosely modeled after these earlier leaflets. The crimes have expanded to include far more weighty ones than civil disobedience. Ross and Richards (coauthors Convict Criminogy) offer advice on what to do if your front door is bashed in by police in a drug bust and how to avoid fatal legal mistakes. Writing in sections under topical headings the authors follow an anonymous everyman (or woman) through an arrest a trial and an incarceration. The legal system they depict bears no resemblance to the one in school textbooks. It is the enemy. The authors describe different types of prisons and suggest how to deal with the correctional officers the other inmates and various types of discipline. Finally they discuss making parole and returning to life on the outside. An appendix offers a glossary of prison slang and a statement about the status of prisons in America today. Overall this is an absorbing original book that should be required reading for criminal justice classes. Ostensibly intended for the person who is caught committing the crime in reality Behind Bars gives the outsider an in-depth look at what it is like to be in prison in America today.

002866020X,Encyclopedia of Race And Racism (Encyclopedia of Race and Racism) 3 Volume Set,Books,*Starred Review* The introduction to the Encyclopdia of Race &amp; Racism states that race and racism are two different terms with different histories. The set explores the historical origin of these concepts and their social and scientific impact throughout history. There are approximately 400 entries from 350 contributors arranged around 28 themes such as &#x201C;Colonialism&#x201D; &#x201C;Genetic and Biological Concepts&#x201D;&#xA0;&#x201C;Genocide&#x201D;&#xA0;and &#x201C;Popular Culture.&#x201D; Although the U.S. receives the most attention the encyclopedia provides&#xA0;a worldwide perspective on race and racism with articles on cultural groups such as Burakumin Dalits&#xA0;and Roma;&#xA0;individuals such as Stephen Biko and Nelson Mandela; and concepts such as Black feminism in Brazil English skinheads and Indigenismo in Mexico. A series of articles covers the colonization of Africa by&#xA0;various European nations and is accompanied by maps displaying the regions they claimed.   The third volume contains an annotated filmography listing both feature films and documentaries; a selection of several primary sources including &#x201C;Protocols of the Elders of Zion&#x201D; the &#x201C;Lusaka Manifesto&#x201D; on southern Africa and the &#x201C;Report on Crimes against Humanity in Guatemala&#x201D;;&#xA0;and an easily accessible index to the volumes. See also references link some related entries and bibliographies following each entry can provide further reading. A number of maps drawings and photographs add to the text. The caption for a&#xA0;photo in the article on Color-blind racism implies that the Los Angeles Urban League supported California Proposition 209&#xA0;to ban race or gender preferences in public hiring but in fact the Los Angeles Urban League was against the proposition.&#xA0;In addition a map of Italian colonies in Africa in 1914 fails to show&#xA0;Italian Somalia.   The set is very comprehensive in its coverage of both race and racism and deserves credit for clear and concise explanations of a variety of often confusing issues for example multiculturalism tokenism immigration and IQ testing. The Encyclopedia of Racism in the United States (Greenwood 2005) is a similar work though focused solely on the U.S. and some libraries may opt not to update their collections with this new set. It is&#xA0;however highly recommended for most&#xA0;libraries based on its broad look at race and racism and well-researched articles&#xA0;showing how and why people came to believe racist theories and refuting those beliefs.&#xA0;This title is also available as an e-book. --Steve Stratton

0028659287,Encyclopedia Judaica 22 Volume Set,Books,Grade 10 Up&mdash;This long-awaited revision of the premier reference source on Jewish life culture and history updates the 1972 edition by either adding to the original information or creating a completely new entry. New to this publication are a charted summary of transliteration rules; a list of abbreviations; and entries discussing aspects of Holocaust study the development and impact of the State of Israel on Jewish life and the evolution of Reform Conservative Orthodox Hasidic and Reconstructionist branches of the faith. Entries on Judaism in all 50 U.S. states and major U.S. cities have been updated. Others are unchanged although updating may have been warranted: for example information on the biblical character Noah is unaltered despite a great deal of related research both textual and archaeological since 1972. However many entries related to religious law (halakhah) have been totally rewritten to reflect its impact on the Israeli legal system. This edition consists of 22 volumes compared to the original 16. It boasts all new illustrations: more than 600 maps charts archaeological plans and chronologies (for example family trees and an 8-page chart of Hasidic dynasties) and a few color photographs of paintings drawings and artifacts in each volume. The glossary is unchanged. The last volume contains a detailed 270-page thematic outline and a superb 632-page index that make the information in each volume accessible. Libraries that own the first edition will want to replace it with this one.&mdash;Jack Forman Mesa College Library San DiegoCopyright &copy; Reed Business Information a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

0028658477,Encyclopedia of Genocide and Crimes Against Humanity - 3 Volume Set (T-Z-Index),Books,*Starred Review*  This outstanding comprehensive sourcebook of the worst in human behavior throughout history also includes instances of some of the best responses. It is aimed at the adult general reader but will be valuable for both specialists and older students studying the destruction of a people. The editor and contributors are broadly representative of academic experts around the world and some of them have had extensive involvement with the subject.The 350 signed well-documented entries varying from 500 to 5000 words as appropriate are arranged alphabetically. The topics comprise the diverse aspects of crimes against humanity--acts and consequences cultural memory and representation international institutions and laws. Each article is well written balanced (such as the entry on the Sabra and Shatila Palestinian refugee camps) and includessee alsoreferences and a bibliography. The set covers judicial decisions and events as recent as mid-2004. There is some overlap (for example in treating different aspects of the crimes in the Balkans) but each entry is fresh and shows careful editing.Every continent and likely every people have had their share of the crimes and while the impact of the Nazi Holocaust drives much of the work the editorial team has cast its net wide encompassing for example less-known crimes against the Beothuk people in Newfoundland and Labrador. Birth and death dates of persons and specific dates of the crimes are given. Entries cover ancient and modern genocidesperpetratorsandVictimsincitementandresistancedenialanddocumentation international tribunals and national trials and cultural aspects such as the ways in which genocide intersects with music and dance. The work includes separate two-page entries on the atrocities at Carthage Srebrenica and Wounded Knee as well as concise biographies for individuals ranging from Klaus Barbie chief of the gestapo in France to Louise Arbor chief prosecutor for the International Tribune for the Former Yugoslavia. Concluding the set are a glossary an excellent filmography 190 pages of primary sources (historical and international texts and judicial decisions) and an accurate index which is supplemented by a topical list of entries. Black-and-white photos convey some of the horror of what humanity has wrought. The layout of this very accessible work is noteworthy.The Encyclopedia of Genocide(ABC-CLIO 1999) emphasizes the Nazi Holocaust and does not aim to cover the entire history and range of genocides. The new work has twice the number of pages and is larger in physical size. It will be the standard resource for many years.Arthur MeyersCopyright &#169; American Library Association.

0028810694,Nuts! the Battle of the Bulge: The Story and Photographs,Books,Hitler and his general staff were convinced that if the Allies on the Continent were struck a shattering blow their unity would collapse. In mid-December 1944 they planned and executed a sudden but unsuccessful counterattack westward through the Forest of Ardennes that on combat maps produced a change in the battle line forever known as the Bulge. Following the format and scope of their earlier works The Way It Was (LJ 8/91) and D-Day Normandy (LJ 4/1/94) the authors have reconstructed the sense of those uncertain days in the frozen Belgian woods. Hundreds of photos taken from American and German sources capture the world of combat from the perspective of foot soldiers and tank crewmen in all its powerful gritty and often gruesome reality. A valuable addition to any collection on this subject.Mel D. Lane Sacramento Cal.Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information Inc.

He urges that prisons be ruled as constitutional governments with prison authorities who are strong enough to control inmates but compassionate enough to gain respect.

Giving historically significant examples of leaders Gardner shows the tremendous amount of energy talent and dormant enthusiasm that can be mobilized by effective leaders in all levels of society. Given the current apathetic situation he decries this easily read inspiring text should be required reading for all high-school social studies classes.

Author of the seminalThe Nature of Managerial Work(1973) Mintzberg traces the rise of strategic planning from 1965 noting the fervor with which it came to be embraced and analyzes its origins and history. His main thesis is that planning and strategy making are mutually exclusive activities. While acknowledging a vital role for planning he claims that the process can straitjacket an organization by stifling innovation and commitment. On the other hand strategy making is a fluid informal process requiring adaptability. Mintzberg includes an impressive amount of research in this scholarly readable treatise and he suggests how strategy making and planning can be implemented to complement each other. This should prove to be an important work.David Rouse

0029320402,New Manufacturing Challenge: Techniques for Continuous Improvement,Books,Maintaining world competitiveness has been the clarion call for many industries in the 1980s. For manufacturing companies improving production efficiency has been the key. This work lays out specific suggestions for improving manufacturing techniques on the shop floor. The chapters profusely illustrated treat topics such as quick setup job rotation U-shaped production lines and preventive maintenance. In each the author uses his diverse experience as an efficiency expert for several leading consulting houses to good advantage. However the volume lacks a strong philosophical framework and comes off rather like a dry list of helpful hints. Recommended only for production specialists. Gene R.

He graduated from Cornell University with majors in Journalism and science writing in 1967. He moved to New York to pursue a career but had a weekend house (a run down farm) near Cornell. Because his father was a botanist and naturalist he took to rural life and learned plant lore. He took a leave of absence and moved to the upstate NY farm and produced much of the manuscript there. Later Hall became senior editor charge of science environment and energy coverage at BusinessWeek. He also served as Executive Editor at Scientific American magazine. Today he teaches online courses in journalism at the University of Massachusetts in Amherst. Hall has received numerous journalism awards including the AAAS/ Westinghouse Journalism Award and is a recipient of the McGraw-Hill Corporate Achievement Award. His projects have both won and been finalists for the prestigious National Magazine Award.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.

Of course anything would be better than what they had before but for most of them their grades have improved this semester.  All four struggle with biology so I think the book does help.  Other students that I have asked this semester like the book and feel it is very readable.  It also has worked out well to use for both 101 and 102.  I am teaching 102 which covers ecosystems evolution and diversity of organisms.  So the chapters I am using are in the following order 1 24 25 9 10 11 12 21 13 and 14.  It is always risky to use chapters out of order but it has worked with your book.

In short this text is ideal for shaping the next generation of scientist practitioners. I am thrilled that Mayer Sulzer-Azaroff and Wallace (2011) will be contributing to the long tradition of graduate training in behavior analysis at Southern Illinois University. --Ruth Anne Rehfeldt BCBA-D Ph.D. Southern Illinois UniversityBeth Sulzer-Azaroff G. Roy Mayer and Michele Wallace deliver the best textbook for applied behavior analysis available. Easy-to-read well-researched and practical this book will provide both students and instructors strategies to solve real life problems. Indeed this book puts the &#34;applied&#34; back into behavior analysis. --Kathleen Dyer CCC-SLP Ph.D. BCBA-D Clinical Director River Street Autism Program at ColtsvilleI have used the previous edition of Behavior Analysis for Lasting Change for a number of years in a graduate-level introductory class in behavior analysis for teacher certification candidates. The text was well organized sequenced coherently clearly written and technically correct. Throughout the chapters there are sufficient and useful illustrations and examples of concepts. The text provides a proper balance of theory and application. On course evaluations students consistently indicated that they enjoyed using the text and found it to be accessible and useful.

0030465311,Arts and Ideas,Books,William Fleming became an associate professor of Fine Arts at Syracuse University in 1945. Feeling that the Humanities program at SU did not sufficiently serve the needs of a growing Fine Arts program Fleming founded the Department of Fine Arts in 1947 and became its first chairman.
